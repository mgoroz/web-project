# On-demand garbage collection

Is the trash delivery taking too long? Or are you paying for too frequent disposals? Not to worry __ODGC__ (_On-demand garbage collection_) is a new and improved way of handling garbage disposal, all the while, of course, staying environmentally friendly. It is extremely easy to set-up – sign-up as a user and request delivery on __your__ own freely chosen date as often or seldom as you desire. We take into consideration the needs of all – homeowners and businesses alike.
